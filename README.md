SUDOKU solver


Stages Planned :
1. [x] Reading a Sudoku table in a stream format
2. [x] Pretty printing a su-do-ku in the desired format
3. [ ] Checking for a valid su-do-ku matrix
	1. [ ] Row by Row checking
	2. [ ] Column by Column checking
	3. [ ] Box by Box Checking
4. [ ] Generating possibilities for all cells in the matrix
5. [ ] Developing Class-Object model for the sudoku matrix 
6. [ ] Finding 'certain' cells in the matrix and regenerating possibilities after that
7. [ ] Finding 'unique' cells in the matrix and regenerating possibilites after that
8. [ ] Handling 'pairs' and modifying possibilities based on that
9. [ ] Detecting Unsolvable situations
10. [ ] Recursively call the solver after assuming a certain value for a 'pair' and backtracing in case of unsolvable situations
